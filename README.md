CS - 255 Module 8 Project Overview
Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
What did you do particularly well?

The DriverPass project was a project given by a client seeking to start a Drivers Education platform, particularly by using a web application for their clients to sign up, pick various offered packages, and use as their main form of interaction with their customers. I felt taht I did most of the write up's well, putting together the technical documents in a clear and efficient way to best represent what the client desired.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I felt in some parts I was a bit to vague in my descriptions, being more technical and to the point my further improve my ability to translate system design into a written form. 

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing

When interpretating, I used context clues giving from the DriversPass interview to better help me implment needs into the systems design, it is important because without this, the client and or user will recieve something that is less than desired. 

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

When designing software, the first thing that comes to mind is what does the stakeholder desire? Do they have a plan layed out, or are they looking for help in building a path forward? The key here is to work closely with the client to ensure that the system meets needs and requirements, and that these can be meet both within budget, and within an expected time frame.
